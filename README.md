Testing out Modal.com's API and platform.

Used some of their samples for utilizing Stable Diffusion to generate images and wrapped this into a small API.

This would be called with:

https://{url}.modal.run/?query=%22Bill%20Gates%20in%20supreme%20court%22

Replace the url with your own instance.
query = is a urlencoded version of what to generate. It will return an image in PNG form.
